By the end of the class you should feel confident to taking a powerful single board computer and connecting/programming it to perform specific real world tasks. Programs in this class are written in Python. If you haven't seen it before it's pretty easy to learn. If you have seen it, you will hopefully get better with it. Just about every computer system has some sort of way to input data and see results. You will become more comfortable attaching these kinds of devices."
